  <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>

  <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>

  <h2>The Llama</h2>

  <p>Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.</p>

  <h2>The Anaconda</h2>

  <p>The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.</p>
